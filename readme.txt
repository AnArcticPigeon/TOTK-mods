Installation guide:

Copy paste the contents of zipfolder into a dedicated user folder or %appdata%> Roaming> Yuzu
Alternatively: Open Yuzu, top left click on file> open yuzu folder.

Reasoning:
This modpack is made to streamline the installation of Yuzu and Tears of the Kingdom and comes with recommended preset settings.


Updating to 1.1.0++ is recommended, Visual Improvements won't work on 1.0 and 1.0 is a very buggy version.

Crashes and Visual bugs & Extra Recommendations:
Those are often caused by Shaders. Starting with a clean shader cache is recommended when jumping between EA versions a lot.
It's recommended to pick 1 EA version and stay on it :).

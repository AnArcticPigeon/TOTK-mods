Disable FPS++ or DynamicFPS++ (same mod)
Updating to 1.2.1
DFPS 1.5.3 behavior has been largely improved and now will be apart of the modfolder due to more frequent updates.
Huge upgrades to LOD and skyislands, doesn't seem to have performance impact from my testing.
Enjoy the game.
DFPS 1.5.2 causes less stuttering and 1.5.3 fixes physic related issues.

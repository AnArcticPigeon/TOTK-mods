This is currently tested and working for yuzu

NOTE: This is tested on a SteamDeck with EmuDeck installed with an externalSD card installed where EmuDeck's defaults and saves and mods are stored. 
This path universally is the following:

For MODS:
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/storage/yuzu/load/0100F2C0115B6000/

For SAVES:
/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/storage/yuzu/nand/user/save/0000000000000000/E0AC79DB11B2AAABE658083F95B60E5F/0100F2C0115B6000/
NOTE: The folder "E0AC79DB11B2AAABE658083F95B60E5F" is randomly generated for each user, so this will be unique. 
You can jump to the saves location in yuzu from right-clicking game, Open Save Data Location

The script will run these commmands in sequence for you shown below.

mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
pip install requests
pip install Pillow
pip install patool
pip install tk

What each command is doing?
---------------
mkdir - creates directory for where miniconda3 will be downloaded from linux repository and placed. 
wget - will grab the latest version for SteamOS, and then run the miniconda shell script. 
bash - running bash using the miniconda.sh script with expressions for the downloaded Miniconda3 repo.
bash breakdown
-b: This is an option for the script. It stands for "batch mode" and indicates that the script should be run in non-interactive mode, meaning it won't prompt the user for input during its execution.
-u: This is another option for the script. It will check the bash script to ensure it can run, and for any errors if arguments were not meant to be passed.
-p ~/folder: This is the final option for the script.sh script. It stands for "prefix" and provides a value indicating the directory for where bash is intended to run.
rm - removes the miniconda.sh bash script, no longer needed
init bash - initializes bash to run within the miniconda3/bin/conda directory
init zsh - 
---------------
miniconda3
a smaller version of "Conda"
Conda is an environment management system  that will allow for running, and installing certain dependencies. As a Package Manager, this is a solution if there are multiple versions of python installed and only want to run a specific version that correspond to specific packages. Mor on the differences here: https://towardsdatascience.com/managing-project-specific-environments-with-conda-b8b50aa8be0e?gi=06afd905956e

miniconda3 will allow installing the packages using pip, which would otherwise require root, changing SteamDeck readonly system, etc. 
The commands below, or the provided script is all that is necessary to run the Mod Manager tool created by Last Breath on SteamDeck.
